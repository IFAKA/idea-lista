# Automatic System Theme Detection for Idea-lista

## Overview

The popup now automatically adapts to your system's theme preference with the following features:

- **Automatic system theme detection**: The popup automatically detects and applies your system's light/dark theme preference
- **Real-time theme switching**: The theme changes immediately when your system theme changes
- **No manual intervention required**: The popup seamlessly follows your OS theme settings

## How it Works

### System Theme Detection
- The popup detects your system's color scheme preference using `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`
- When your system is set to dark mode, the popup automatically uses dark theme
- When your system is set to light mode, the popup automatically uses light theme
- Changes to system theme are detected in real-time and applied immediately

### No Manual Controls
- No theme toggle button is needed
- No user preferences to manage
- The popup always matches your system preference

## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified:

1. **`popup.html`** - Added automatic theme detection script that runs before page load
2. **`src/lib/theme.ts`** - Simplified theme utility functions for automatic detection
3. **`src/App.tsx`** - Initializes theme system on app load

### CSS Variables
The theme system uses CSS custom properties defined in `src/index.css`:

```css
:root {
  /* Light theme variables */
  --background: 0 0% 100%;
  --foreground: 0 0% 3.9%;
  /* ... more variables */
}

.dark {
  /* Dark theme variables */
  --background: 0 0% 3.9%;
  --foreground: 0 0% 98%;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Tailwind Configuration
The `tailwind.config.js` is already configured for dark mode with `darkMode: ["class"]`, which means:
- Dark mode is activated by adding the `dark` class to the `<html>` element
- All Tailwind dark mode classes (e.g., `dark:bg-gray-900`) work automatically

## Usage

### For Users:
- Simply change your system theme (OS settings)
- The popup will automatically match your system preference
- No additional configuration needed

### For Developers:
The theme system is fully integrated with your existing shadcn/ui components and will automatically work with:
- All existing UI components
- Custom components using Tailwind classes
- Any new components you add

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern browsers**: Full support with real-time system theme detection
- **Older browsers**: Fallback support without real-time detection
- **Chrome Extensions**: Fully compatible with Chrome extension popup limitations

## Testing

To test the theme system:

1. **System theme**: Change your OS theme and reload the extension
2. **Real-time switching**: Change system theme while extension is open
3. **Automatic detection**: Verify the popup matches your system theme immediately

The theme system provides a seamless, professional experience that automatically adapts to user preferences without requiring any manual configuration.

- **Key Elements**:
  - Complete directory structure
  - File responsibilities and purposes
  - Naming conventions
  - Import/export patterns

## How to Use These Rules

### 1. Automatic Application
Rules marked with `alwaysApply: true` are automatically included in all AI interactions:
- `apple-design-system.mdc`
- `animation-principles.mdc`
- `ui-ux-guidelines.mdc`
- `chrome-extension-architecture.mdc`

### 2. Context-Specific Application
Rules marked with `globs` are applied when working with specific file types:
- `content-script-patterns.mdc` - Applied when working with `content.js` or `styles.css`

### 3. Manual Application
Rules can be manually referenced using `@ruleName`:
```
@apple-design-system
@animation-principles
@ui-ux-guidelines
```

## Rule Categories

### üéØ Always Applied (Core Rules)
These rules define the fundamental design and architecture principles:

1. **Apple Design System** - Color palette, typography, spacing
2. **Animation Principles** - Apple Watch-inspired animations
3. **UI/UX Guidelines** - Interface patterns and accessibility
4. **Chrome Extension Architecture** - Modular structure and standards

### üîß Context-Specific Rules
These rules are applied based on the files being worked with:

1. **Content Script Patterns** - Idealista integration patterns
2. **Scoring Algorithm** - Property evaluation system
3. **Project Structure** - File organization and responsibilities

## Best Practices

### When Creating New Components
1. Reference the Apple Design System for colors and spacing
2. Apply animation principles for interactions
3. Follow UI/UX guidelines for accessibility
4. Use the modular architecture pattern

### When Modifying Existing Code
1. Ensure consistency with the design system
2. Maintain animation performance standards
3. Preserve accessibility features
4. Follow the established architecture patterns

### When Adding New Features
1. Consider the scoring algorithm impact
2. Follow content script patterns for integration
3. Maintain the icon-only interface principle
4. Use the universal modal system

## Rule Maintenance

### Updating Rules
- Rules should be updated when design decisions change
- Version control all rule changes
- Document breaking changes
- Test rule application in different contexts

### Adding New Rules
- Keep rules focused and specific
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include examples and code snippets
- Maintain consistency with existing rules

### Rule Validation
- Ensure rules don't conflict with each other
- Test rule application in real scenarios
- Validate rule effectiveness
- Gather feedback on rule clarity

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Code Review
- Use rules as checklist for code reviews
- Ensure new code follows established patterns
- Validate design system compliance
- Check animation performance

### Documentation
- Rules serve as living documentation
- Update rules when patterns evolve
- Use rules for onboarding new developers
- Reference rules in commit messages

### Testing
- Test rule application in different contexts
- Validate rule effectiveness
- Ensure rules don't create conflicts
- Monitor rule impact on development speed

## Troubleshooting

### Rule Not Applying
1. Check rule file syntax and metadata
2. Verify `alwaysApply` and `globs` settings
3. Ensure rule file is in correct location
4. Restart Cursor if needed

### Conflicting Rules
1. Review rule priorities
2. Resolve conflicts in rule definitions
3. Use more specific glob patterns
4. Consolidate overlapping rules

### Performance Issues
1. Optimize rule content for faster loading
2. Use specific glob patterns to limit scope
3. Remove unused or redundant rules
4. Monitor rule application performance
